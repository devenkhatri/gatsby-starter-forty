  A content management system (CMS) is an application that is used to manage web
  content, allowing multiple contributors to create, edit and publish. Content
  in a CMS is typically stored in a database and displayed in a presentation
  layer based on a set of templates.


  The following are the basic features of a CMS:


  * Content creation (allows users to easily create and format content)

  * Content storage (stores content in one place, in a consistent fashion)

  * Workflow management (assigns privileges and responsibilities based on roles
  such as authors, editors and admins)

  * Publishing (organizes and pushes content live)

      A content management system (CMS) typically has two major components: a
      content management application (CMA), as the front-end user interface that
      allows a user, even with limited expertise, to add, modify, and remove
      content from a website without the intervention of
      a[webmaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webmaster "Webmaster"); and a
      content delivery application (CDA), that compiles the content and updates
      the website.

      * Intuitive indexing, search and retrieval features index all data for
      easy access through search functions and allow users to search by
      attributes such as publication dates, keywords or author.

      * Format management facilitates turn scanned paper documents and legacy
      electronic documents into HTML or PDF documents.

      * Revision features allow content to be updated and edited after initial
      publication. Revision control also tracks any changes made to files by
      individuals.

      * Publishing functionality allows individuals to use a template or a set
      of templates approved by the organization, as well as wizards and other
      tools to create or modify content.

      [Digital asset management
      systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_asset_management "Digital
      asset management")are another type of CMS. They manage content with
      clearly defined author or ownership, such as documents, movies, pictures,
      phone numbers, and scientific data. Companies also use CMSs to store,
      control, revise, and publish documentation.


      There are also[component content management
      systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_content_management_system
      "Component content management system")(CCMS), which are CMSs that manage
      content at a modular level rather than as pages or articles. CCMSs are
      often used in technical communication where many publications reuse the
      same content.
