  A content management system (CMS) is an application that is used to manage web
  content, allowing multiple contributors to create, edit and publish. Content
  in a CMS is typically stored in a database and displayed in a presentation
  layer based on a set of templates.


  The following are the basic features of a CMS:


  Content creation (allows users to easily create and format content)

  Content storage (stores content in one place, in a consistent fashion)

  Workflow management (assigns privileges and responsibilities based on roles
  such as authors, editors and admins)

  Publishing (organizes and pushes content live)
